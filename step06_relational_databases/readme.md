### Serverless PostgreSQL Databases

Reading Material:

[CockroachDB Serverless Launches, Aspires to Be Developersâ€™ Database](https://thenewstack.io/cockroachdb-serverless-launches-aspires-to-be-developers-database/)

A new class of Serverless PostgreSQL Databases are emerging we plan to focus on them:

1. [Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/)
2. [Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/postgresql/hyperscale/)
3. [CockroachDB Serverless](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/how-we-built-cockroachdb-serverless/)

CockroachDB Serverless runs on all three major cloud platforms, without requiring an account on any one of them and also has a free tier. This versatility is attractive to developers and for teaching students. Therefore, we will use it for teaching.
